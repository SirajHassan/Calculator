# Calculator
This Calculator Django App is a web app was deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Users can enter a calculation, then the last 10 answers ever inputted to the website
are displayed and updated without refreshing the page. This was done via AJAX. 

This app was made for a company coding challenge. I also did it to learn about Django,
AJAX and AWS tools.
